## Why?

I want a simple Todo app with good keyboard navigation. I don't know of one, so I decided to make it!

It also doubles as good IndexedDB practice.

## Todo:

* Subtasks (and subtasks for the subtasks!)
  * Indent level for each level
  * selecting task collapses children

* Responsive design for mobile
